<P>If you find these projects useful, please <A HREF="http://www.devsphere.com/servlet/contact">send us a short email</A> describing any improvements you'd like to see in the future versions. If you don't find here what you need, we still want to hear from you since Devsphere provides custom <A HREF="http://www.devsphere.com/services/xml.html">Java XML Solutions</A> based on open source software. The Java XML Projects of Devsphere are developed by <B>Andrei Cioroianu</B> who co-authored <B>Java XML Programmer's Reference</B> and <B>Professional Java XML</B> published by <B>Wrox Press</B>.</P>

<H2>XML JSP Tag Library</H2>

<P><B>demo/taglib/xjtldemo.war</B> is a Java Web Application that uses 
XML JSP Tag Library (XJTL) and JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL). 
It was tested with Apache Tomcat 4 + JDK 1.4 and with Apache Tomcat 4 + Xalan + JDK 1.3.

<P>All <A HREF="docs/taglib/output/examples.html">XML Output</A> 
and <A HREF="docs/taglib/process/examples.html">XML Processing</A>
examples are fully documented.

<P><B>Note:</B> Currently, XJTL supports JSP 1.2 and uses Apache JSTL 1.0 
to evaluate the ${...} expressions. Therefore, you have to deploy XJTL together 
with JSTL. The next version of XJTL will be based only on JSP 2.0.
The XJTLDEMO web app contains the JAR files of JSTL 1.0 and it is assumed that 
the JAXP 1.1 implementation is provided by the JDK or app server. 
If you don't use JDK 1.4, make sure that your classpath contains 
a JAXP 1.1 parser (Xerces or Crimson) and the Xalan XSLT processor.

<H2>SAXDOMIX Framework</H2>

<P><B>demo/saxdomix</B> contains examples based on the SAXDOMIX framework.
To run the examples, execute the *.bat or *.sh files from demo/saxdomix.
If you don't use JDK 1.4, make sure that your classpath contains
a JAXP 1.1 parser (Xerces or Crimson) and the Xalan XSLT processor.


<H2>XML Parsing Benchmark</H2>

<P><B>demo/benchmark</B> contains the *.bat files for running the benchmark.
You'll have to edit initEnv.bat and set the JDK and parser paths.
